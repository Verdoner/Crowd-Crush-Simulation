        <h1>Crowd crush simulator</h1>
        <p>
            This crowd crush simulation is the product of a project done by a group of 2-semester software students at Aalborg University.
            The focus of this project is to make simulations of previous crowd crush events, by researching and analyzing these events and comparing them. 
            Giving the user the ability to customize the given events, it can help to better understand how important certain tools can be in aiding in preventing these deadly crowd crush events.
