            <h2 id="howToUse">How to use the program:</h2>
            <p>
                <b>"Amount of people" slider:</b>
                <br>
                The user can utilize the slider to decide how many people should be inserted into the simulation, by pulling the blue dot from side to side. The number can also be changed using the number box underneath the slider, for a more precise amount.
                <br><br>
                
                <b>"Insert Barriers" button:</b>
                <br>
                A toggle button, that the user can utilize to drag and draw barriers across the simulation. To insert the barriers, the button must be pressed, and when the user is done inserting barriers, the button must be pressed again before the simulation can be started.
                <br>
                The barriers are used to guide/direct/contain the people in the simulation.
                <br><br>
                
                <b>"Reset Simulation" button:</b>
                <br>
                When the button is pressed, all of the simulation data will be reset, and barriers and people will be cleared from the simulation.
                <br><br>

                <b>"Start/Stop Simulation" button:</b>
                <br>
                When the user is ready to start the simulation, they can press the blue "Start Simulation" button. The button hereafter turns red, and becomes the "Stop Simulation" button. This button can be pressed when the user wants to stop the simulation, and the result page will pop up.
                <br><br>

                <b>"Pause/Play" button:</b>
                <br>
                A button that allows the user to pause and play the simulation while it is running, without resetting it.
