                    <h1>More About Hajj</h1>
                    <p>
                        Over the last 30+ years, several incidents of crowd crushes have occurred during the yearly Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, also known as Hajj.
                        The incident with the most casualties due to a stampede occurred in 1990, where 1426 pilgrims died. 
                        This stampede took place in a pedestrian tunnel, tunnel Al-Ma'aisim, leading from Mecca towards Mina. 
                        Many of the other incidents were caused by stampedes at the stoning of the Devil ritual.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After the incident in 2004, the Saudi government decided to appoint a commission to recommend a plan for the development of the Hajj sites, to help prevent any further incidents from happening.
                        One of the changes made to the Hajj sites was the renovation of the Jamarat bridge.
                        The new bridge would have four floors, with 12 entrances and 12 exits.
                        The bridge would also include "the most advanced early warning system to prevent overcrowding and stampedes".
                        The bridge was due to be completed around 3 years after the 2004 incident.
                        The government also set quotas for the amount of pilgrims allowed from each country, and they required the citizens to register when and if they would be attending hajj. 
                        Despite these actions taken after the 2004 stampede, 346 pilgrims died due to another stampede during the Muslim pilgrimage in 2006. 
                        The incident occured at the Jamarat bridge, since the renovation had not yet been completed, but the number of incidents greatly decreased following the renovation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        According to studies by Dirk Helbing, Anders Johansson, and Habib Zein Al-Abideen, 
                        the local densities of pilgrims reached values greater than 10 people pr. squaremeter, 
                        which caused problems, since their studies showed that exceeding six people pr. squaremeter would resolve in the local flow decreasing, 
                        so that the inflow would be greater than the outflow, and the pilgrims were hereby unable to exit the big mass of people.
                        This caused a higher and higher compression in the crowd of pilgrims, which in the end caused the density of people to become critical, which leads to people getting crushed. 
                        The study also concluded that even when the density of people was at the extreme, the average local speed and flow never stopped, 
                        which is where humans differ from vehicle traffic, since motor vehicles have to keep a certain safety distance to avoid collisions. 
                        Since the flow never stops, it can also result in the crowd dynamic to experience possible shock waves, which can cause safety hazards for the people in the crowd. 
                        The study observed two different kinds of "waves", one being "stop-and-go" waves, where the mass of people no longer had a steady flow, 
                        but would stop for short periods and the suddenly move again. 
                        This kind of wave is assumed to be caused by the bottleneck areas, where coordination problems cause an alteration between the forward movement of the pilgrims, and backwards gaps appearing. 
                        The other kind of wave is the "crowd turbulence", which is the transition from stop-and-go movements to irregular flows. 
                        This turbulence is caused by a sequence of instabilities in the flow pattern. 
                        These instabilities are most likely what causes people to stumble, and since the crowd of people does not stop moving, 
                        the fallen individuals will get trampled if they do not get back up fast enough, and this is where the stampedes occur. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The turbulent conditions have been observed to be so unbearable that the people try to escape the crowd and start pushing the others around them, also known as "crowd panic". 
                        Even though the normal flow of the crowd can be compared to the flow of a liquid, the crowd panic causes particularly violent displacements in dense crowds, contrasting the human flow from that of a liquid. 
                        This type of scenario can be practically impossible to control, even if security was to step in and try to get a hold of the situation. 
                        The turbulent dynamics are where most of the problems occur, and have been observed on several other occasions than the 2006 Hajj, and it is therefore important to look into why, where and when these situations occur.

                    <h1>More About Love Parade</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Love parade was an electronic dance music festival held in Germany, which had its last iteration in 2010, where it was held in the city of Duisburg. 
                        The festival got canceled since it ended in a crowd disaster with 21 deaths and over 600 injured, because of an overcrowded ramp leading to the festival area from a tunnel. 
                        The disaster resulted from several contributing factors which all led to the ramp being overcrowded. 
                        One of which were the layout of the festival area, which was approximately 100,000 squaremeters large, and constrained by a railway on one side and a freeway on the other side. 
                        This meant that the only entrance to the festival area was via a tunnel located at one end of the ramp, which also served as the only exit from the festival area. 
                        Together, the tunnel and ramp created and inverse t-shape which determined the in- and outflow from the festival. 
                        Based on the size of the tunnel and ramp, the maximum flow of people would be 114,660 persons pr. hour and a density of 1.75 people pr. squaremeter, which in itself is not a dangerous density. 
                        However, the entire ramp was not usable, which led to a significantly lower capacity of the ramp. 
                        The entire ramp was not usable because of multiple factors, such as the 90 degree turn to and from the tunnel created by the inverse t-shape, which was expected to reduce the capacity. 
                        The counterflow of visitors leaving the festival was also expected to reduce the capacity by 6-14%, resulting in a lower capacity. 
                        According to the organizers, they expected an inflow of 90,000 and an outflow of 55,000 people in the hour between 17:00 and 18:00, 
                        which is hard to predict since the event was free, this means that the predicted flow exceeds the maximum flow of 114,660 people pr. hour, there would be with a fully usable ramp, 
                        so with an even lower capacity because of the 90 degree turn, the reduced capacity because of the outflow as well as multiple fences, 
                        food trucks and toilets along the ramp, the ramp would be extremely crowded and with a much higher crowd density.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The placement of the entrance and exit next to each other meant that the in- and outflow of people both had to pass through the ramp, 
                        which led to a dense-counterflow of people in this area, that occurred because of a lack of directional flow separation. 
                        These in- and outflows ended up blocking each other, which meant that people were not able to leave the ramp as the density of people increased. 
                        This increase in density led to the emergence of an unintentional dynamic of the crowd called crowd turbulence. 
                        During crowd turbulence the density of people is so high that physical interaction between people can not be avoided and transfers forces from one body to others. 
                        This may lead to force chains being formed, such that the direction and strength of the forces are varying and hard to predict. 
                        Therefore an uncontrollable collective dynamic of the crowd occurs which can cause various injuries to the individuals in the crowd. 
                        The individuals in the crowd are exposed to a high risk of losing their balance and falling down, which then makes them into an obstacle for others in the crowd. 
                        Because of the strong forces affecting the surrounding individuals of a person that have fallen over, 
                        others become likely to fall on top of the people that are already lying on the ground, which creates a domino effect. 
                        This creates a pile of people where nobody can easily get back on their feet, and those on the bottom get crushed by the weight of the people on top, 
                        which makes it difficult for them to breathe, and they are therefore likely to asphyxiate. 
                        The cause of the death for all of the victims during the Love Parade were compression to the chest which led to them asphyxiating.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There were made no preventive measures to prevent similar situations happening in the future, because all future iterations of the festival were canceled. 
                        Although, no preventive measures were made, there still exist multiple factors that could have been improved, better working police cordons at the entrance of the festival area. 
                        The police cordons were intended to dissolve the crowded area in front of the entrance of the festival area, which did not work as intended. 
                        The police cordons had worked better if the flow had been unidirectional instead of an uncontrolled flow direction, which made the in- and outflow blend together.

                    <p>
                        The Seoul Halloween crowd crush happened in the evening on the 29th of October 2022, where an estimated 100.000 people gathered to celebrate the first official Halloween event since the country's Covid lockdown. 
                        The majority of the celebrations happened in the downtown district of Seoul, the Itaewon district. 
                        This district is known for its night activities, bars, restaurants, and clubs, but also for the relatively narrow and clustered streets, with no side exits. 
                        According to eyewitnesses of the event, the crowd crush mainly happened on one of the narrower and steeper alleyways connecting two of the larger streets of the district. 
                        This street has a 7 meter wide opening at the top of the slope but narrows down to 3.6 meters effectively creating a 42 meters long funnel, or a bottleneck, with a height difference of 4.3 meters from top to bottom. 
                        A metro station near the bottom of the alleyway led many people up into the heart of the crowd, further urging newcomers through the alleyway, but against the wave of people coming from the "funnel's" top. 
                        This reportedly led to a density of 12 people per square meter, making it near impossible for any individual to move, but rather the individual moving with the crowd as a whole.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Witnesses reported seeing several surges throughout the people caught in the alleyways, which one would associate with a crowd crush, 
                        leading to waves and crowd collapses causing people to fall on top of each other, as well as many victims of the disaster getting crushed against the side of the buildings surrounding the alleyway. 
                        Throughout the evening, attendees of the event called authorities, both from the main location, but also from other places throughout the Itaewon district, 
                        warning them and asking for police backup due to the number of people attending. 
                        According to the BBC, social media posts could also be seen as the evening progressed, people calling the event and streets of Itaewon unsafe. 
                        Even though the authorities were called several hours before the casualties started, 
                        the police were understaffed and both the fire department and ambulances were largely unable to reach the location where most of the casualties occurred. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The police had officially sent 137 police officers to maintain order during this event in Itaewon, however, due to a lack of research, miscommunication, and largely a lack of backup, 
                        they failed to respond efficiently to the emergencies occurring during the night. 
                        According to the police, these officers were primarily sent out to monitor crime, such as narcotics use as well as theft, but not to manage the crowd. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        According to Chosun, a South Korean news station, the fire department announced throughout the night more than 140 deceased, however, 
                        the South Korean government officially announced 158 dead, but changed the official number to 159, 
                        due to a suicide ruled as a consequence of the event a month later. 
                        Different media throughout the world has called the event the "Itaewon Halloween stampede", however, 
                        no initial event occurred leading to believe that it was a panic surging through the crowd, causing the crowd crush, 
                        but rather, bad crowd management and misjudgment in the number of people attending from the authorities. 
                        However, eyewitnesses stated people began to panic, quickly worsening the situation and spreading the panic to nearby streets, 
                        possibly leading to the nickname "Itaewon stampede".
